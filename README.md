# Global-Sentiment-Analysis-AWS on Twitter, News, Stocks
 
Hey There !!

Another data science project, this time Ive made it interactive and hosted on AWS. Its a trend analyser, calculates the sentiment for the search keyword by pulling/scrapping data from different Sources like Twitter, Global news articles and also from Finviz for stock trends(Only NYSE Listed ones).

Three charts will be populated for each search key. "Twitter sentiment" - "Glocal news articles sentiment" - "Stock sentiment if the keyword matches the NYSE/Nasdaq listed Stock ticker"(Ex: GOOG, TSLA, MSFT...etc).

Try searching a key word , Ex: Crypto, Tesla, MSFT, AAPL...etc. More info in the website.
